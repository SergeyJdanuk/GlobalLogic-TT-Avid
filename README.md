# Project

Write a simple single page application for adding users to the dictionary list.
There should be the form for entering user data: name, phone number, email address and home site url. On submit this data should be sent to the rest endpoint using ajax call. You donâ€™t need to implement server side, just simulate the server response which should contain created user id generated on server side. After the user was created you should add a record of him into the table below the form.

The goal of this task is to show ability to write properly structured client side code. Write the code as if it needs to be production quality application (which means structure, maintainability, validation, separation of responsibility between layers). 

The focus should be on the proper/readable/maintainable implementation, not fancy UI (while pretty UI is a plus).
It is allowed to use only jQuery library.

Delivery format:
userDictionary.html + all needed js/css files, runnable without backend.

Use MVC to structure your code.
